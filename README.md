# AlgorithmVisualizer
This is a web app built to visualize various pathfinding and sorting algorithms. The app is not finished yet, but have fun playing around with it in the current state.

The app can be accessed here: https://mpavich2.github.io/AlgorithmVisualizer/
# Purpose
I wanted to try to improve my skills with Javascript and HTML. I also wanted to learn different types of pathfinding and sorting algorithms. This project ended up being a great way to achieve both of those goals.
